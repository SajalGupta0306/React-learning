// Redux Thunk is a middleware that allows you to call the action creators that return a function(thunk) which takes the storeâ€™s dispatch method
// as the argument and which is afterwards used to dispatch the synchronous action after the API or side effects has been finished.

// Middleware allows for side effects to be run without blocking state updates.
// We can run side effects (like API requests) in response to a specific action, or in response to every action that is dispatched (like logging).
// There can be numerous middleware that an action runs through before ending in a reducer.

// for redux-thunk setup
// const store = createStore(
//   reducer,
//   applyMiddleware(thunk),
//   window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__ && window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__()
// );
